## How to start

Init the git repo (e.g. with `git init`).

`./create_environment` or if you prefer, run these
manually:

* `poetry install`
* `poetry run pre-commit install`
* `poetry run pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg`

**Important note**: After running these commands you will need to run git commit either using poetry (`poetry run git commit`) or enable venv in your terminal (`poetry shell`)

To fetch from and upload data to S3 use the following commands:

* `poetry run cli sync-data-from-s3`
* `poetry run cli sync-data-to-s3`

### Python and missing imports

Because of use of virtualenv editor will probably not see any imports correctly. To fix that in VSCode you need to choose interpreter.
Here's an instruction how to do it: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments

**It might require restart of VSCode after poetry install** (only install is problematic when new virtualenv is created, but further updates are handled correctly)

## Work conventions

 * Each task should be done in a separate branch
 * Merge to master should be done after a review and at least one aprove and without unresolved issues
 * You should test your code if possible - use pytest for that
 * Whether possible - typehint your code. It's MUCH easier later to debug stuff.
 * If necessary, install our existing code (from other repositories in NaturalAntibody workspace) using poetry (git+https protocol)
 * In your commit message, on a first line, try to add task number like NARD-<number>. This way it should link to an issue in JIRA


## Suggested editor extensions
We're mostly using VSCode in our workflow. These extensions should be installed at minimum:

 * Editorconfig (code conventions)
 * Mypy (typings verifier)
 * Python extension
 * Jupyter (should be installed by python extension)
 * Pylance (should be installed by python extension)

Other extensions that could be installed are:

 * Project manager (easily switch between projects)
 * Docker extension
 * Remote containers editing
 * GitLens - some additional info about commits inside your editor
